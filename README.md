# Room Key Ops Challenge

Thanks for your interest in joining the team here at Room Key. Part of our evaluation process for potential team members is to have them submit sample project.

## Overview

At Room Key, we believe in DevOps practices such as Cloud Computing, Infrastructure as Code, Immutable Infrastructure, and Continuous Integration. Your challenge is to define the infrastructure for an Open Source application of your choice. You must provide a script that allows anyone with the proper AWS credentials to provision and teardown the infrastructure you defined. The result of the provisioning process will be a highly available 

## Requirements and Expectations

* Application will be accessible over the public internet.
* The application must persist data to some datastore such as MySQL, Redis, etc.
* You are free to use any tools or services AWS offers.
* The application infrastructure must be resilient to failure. If a server goes down, the application will remain available.
* Provide documentation on how to install and use the script.
* Document monitoring and logging needs that a potential team will need to maintain this application in production.  
* Publish your completed project a public Github repo.
